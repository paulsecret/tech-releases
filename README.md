# tech-releases
Information about releases from the tech department

## Structure
Information should be sorted by date. When a new release occurs, it should be
recorded in a file in the directory with the matching date.

For example, a release on 31 March 2025 should be stored in
`2025/03-march/31-monday/releases.txt`.
